## Mobile App
The mobile application is built using Flutter, a cross-platform framework developed by Google. To initialize a new Flutter project, you need to:

1. Install the Flutter SDK on your computer.
2. Create a new Flutter project using the command `flutter create xcloset_app`.
3. Open the project in an IDE and start writing the code.
4. Run the application using the command `flutter run`.

## API
The project's API is built using Laravel, a popular PHP framework. To initialize a new Laravel project, you need to:

1. Install PHP and Composer on your computer.
2. Create a new Laravel project using the command `composer create-project laravel/laravel xcloset_api`.
3. Open the project in an IDE and start writing the code.
4. Run the application using the command `php artisan serve`.

## IoT
The IoT part of the project uses the M5 Stack Core 2, an IoT development board. Additionally, the project utilizes an RFID reader, RFID cards, and a person detection sensor. The project will connect to AWS for data processing and storage.

## Deployment
After running the project smoothly on a personal server, it will be deployed to a server using Docker and AWS. The deployment process will be updated in the future.
